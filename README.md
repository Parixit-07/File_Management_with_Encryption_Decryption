# 🗄️ File Manager with Encryption / Decryption  
A command-line tool that allows you to create, read, edit, delete, and list files — along with encrypting and decrypting them using an extended Caesar cipher.  
Built entirely in C++ using only standard libraries.

## 🚀 Features

### 📁 File Management
- Create new text files  
- Read file contents  
- Append text to existing files  
- Delete files  
- List files (Windows uses `dir`, Linux uses `ls`)

### 🔐 Encryption & Decryption
- Extended Caesar Cipher implementation  
- Key-based dynamic shifting  
- Supports:
  - Lowercase letters  
  - Uppercase letters  
  - Digits  
  - Printable ASCII characters (33–126)  
- Whitespace remains untouched  
- Wrap-around logic for every character range

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **C++**
- **Standard Library (iostream, fstream, string)**

No frameworks or external dependencies.

## 📦 How It Works

### **1. File Operations Menu**
Users can:  
- Create File
- Read File
- Edit File
- Delete File
- List Files


### **2. Encryption / Decryption**
The shift value is derived from the key:


Character handling:
- Alphabet → Rotated within alphabet  
- Numbers → Rotated within 0–9  
- Symbols → Rotated within ASCII 33–126  
- Whitespace → Preserved  
- Byte-by-byte processing
